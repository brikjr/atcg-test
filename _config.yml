Thanks for sharing your Gemfile and _config.yml. Based on the provided files, here are some observations and recommendations:

Gemfile:

Your Gemfile includes the gemspec command, which expects a .gemspec file in the root of your repository. If you're not developing a gem, you might not need this line. Consider removing the gemspec line unless you have a specific reason for including it.
Ensure that all the gems you're using are compatible with the version of Jekyll and GitHub Pages you're using.
_config.yml:

Your _config.yml seems to be set up for the "Chirpy" Jekyll theme. Ensure that this theme is compatible with the version of Jekyll and GitHub Pages you're using.
The error you encountered earlier (Unknown tag 'include_cached') suggests that you might be using a feature or plugin that isn't supported by GitHub Pages or isn't included in your Gemfile. If the "Chirpy" theme uses the include_cached tag, you'll need to ensure that the jekyll-include-cache gem is added to your Gemfile and _config.yml.
Recommendations:

Address the include_cached Error:

If you intend to use the include_cached tag, add the jekyll-include-cache gem to your Gemfile:
ruby
Copy code
gem "jekyll-include-cache"
And also add it to the plugins section of your _config.yml:
yaml
Copy code
plugins:
  - jekyll-include-cache
  ...
If you don't need the include_cached functionality, replace {% include_cached %} with the standard {% include %} tag in your templates.
Check Theme Compatibility:

Ensure that the "Chirpy" theme is compatible with the version of Jekyll and GitHub Pages you're using. If there are updates or patches available for the theme, consider applying them.
Local Testing:

Before pushing changes to your repository, test your Jekyll site locally. This can help you catch and address errors before they cause issues in your CI/CD pipeline. You can do this by running:
bash
Copy code
bundle exec jekyll serve
This will build your site and serve it locally, allowing you to access it via a web browser and check for any issues.
GitHub Pages Plugins:

GitHub Pages supports a limited set of Jekyll plugins. Ensure that any plugins you're using are on the GitHub Pages allowed plugins list. If you're using a plugin that isn't supported by GitHub Pages, you'll need to build your site outside of GitHub Pages and deploy the static files.
By addressing these points and ensuring that all components of your Jekyll site are compatible and correctly configured, you should be able to resolve the build errors. If you encounter further issues or need additional assistance, please let me know!

The provided _config.yml is for the jekyll-theme-chirpy theme. Here are some observations and recommendations based on the provided configuration:

Theme Configuration:

You've set the theme to jekyll-theme-chirpy. Ensure that this theme is installed either as a gem or as a remote theme in your Jekyll project.
Base URL:

The baseurl is set to an empty string. If your site is hosted as a GitHub Pages project site, you should set this to the project name. For example, if your repository is named my-blog, then baseurl should be set to /my-blog.
Language & Timezone:

The site language is set to English (en), and the timezone is set to Asia/Shanghai. Adjust these settings if they don't match your intended audience or location.
Social & Contact Information:

Ensure that placeholders like github_username, twitter_username, and your_full_name are replaced with your actual information.
Comments System:

The comments system is configurable with multiple options like Disqus, Utterances, and Giscus. Ensure you configure the one you want to use and provide the necessary details (e.g., shortname for Disqus).
Progressive Web App (PWA):

PWA is enabled. This allows users to add your website to their home screen on mobile devices and view it offline. Ensure that you have the necessary service worker and manifest files set up for this feature to work correctly.
Exclusions:

Several files and directories are excluded from the Jekyll build process, such as README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and LICENSE. Ensure that these exclusions align with your intentions.
Recommendations:

Fill in Placeholders:

Ensure that all placeholders in the _config.yml file are replaced with your actual information. This includes social media usernames, email addresses, and other personal details.
Local Testing:

As with any Jekyll site, it's a good practice to test your site locally before deploying. This can help you catch any configuration errors or issues. Use the command bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve
